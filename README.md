# Transparent Curricula: Bridging Educational Gaps Across Institutions

## Overview

The Transparent Curricula project aims to shed light on gaps in educational curricula by investigating how peer institutions represent data. By addressing fundamental questions such as "What are other colleges doing for their pathways?" and "How can learning outcomes in courses align with employer expectations?", this project endeavors to provide valuable insights into educational program alignment and evolution.

## Motivation

The project is motivated by the need to make educational pathways more transparent and aligned with industry demands. By exploring the curricular offerings of various institutions, we seek to identify areas where improvements can be made to better prepare students for the workforce.

## Tools Used

- **Python with BeautifulSoup Script:** Utilized for web scraping data from universities' public-facing websites. This script is scheduled to run weekly via cronjob to ensure the data remains up-to-date.
  
- **NeonDB:** A cloud database service employed for storing and managing the scraped data obtained through BeautifulSoup.
  
- **Python's SciKit:** Leveraged as a machine learning library to develop a model that compares FSU coursework with other institutions, identifying and weighing curriculum gaps.
  
- **C# with WebAPI:** Utilized for system design and user interface development. The project utilizes WebAPI, a built-in library, to create web services for seamless data access and interaction.
